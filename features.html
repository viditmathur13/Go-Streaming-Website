        <h1 class="h2"> Demand for streaming media services
             has risen sharply as users
            have come to appreciate the many benefits of this new           
            technology.… </h1>

                    <h1 class="h2"> Media on demand </h1>
                    With audio and video streaming services, users can access and play music, movies, or
television shows whenever they choose, rather than waiting for a show to be aired on TV or for a favorite song
to be played on the radio.

                <h1 class="h2"> Ad-free Viewing </h1>
                While some streaming media services feature ad-supported programming, many also offer ad-
free viewing for users who pay a subscription.

            <h1 class="h2"> Offline options </h1>
            Though streaming media requires an internet connection, many providers offer options to
download content to devices, allowing users to consume media when they are offline.

        <h1 class="h2"> Lower costs </h1>
        Streaming media services may offer lower prices than traditional cable companies. And since
streaming platforms offer access to a vast library of media, it’s much cheaper for users to subscribe to a
streaming media service than to buy individual movies and TV shows on DVDs or music on CDs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h1 class="h2"> Greater flexibility. </h1>
        Streaming media services are favorites of cord-cutters — consumers who abandon
traditional landline phone services and cable television subscriptions in favor of internet-based services.
