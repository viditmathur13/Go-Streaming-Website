            Hey, but what are STREAMING SERVICES??
        </p>
           
        <p>
            Streaming media services are companies that allow viewers to access media content like movies, TV series, music,
            podcasts, and live sporting events over the internet. Users may play streaming media content on a variety of devices,
            including computers, smart TVs, media players, smartphones, and other internet-connected devices. Rather than
            downloading entire media files — which can take quite a long time and consume a large amount of space on a device —
            streaming media services continuously transmit a few seconds of media, which is played immediately on the user’s
            device and is subsequently deleted.
